description:
	This is a little program which will help you list all tables and all columns in a database, just like the command "describe ..." in MySQL database server.
	When you use it at the first time, edit the "Config.ini" file to change some connecting infomations, such as host IP, user name, password, etc.The initial config is my own database config, so it is not suitable for others.Sorry for my lazy. ^_^
	It needs the MySQLdb for python to connect the database, and since I just want to use MySQL, other databases will not suitable for this program.But you can modify it to meet your need!
	This program will publish by GNU GPL v2 license, so feel free to use it!
